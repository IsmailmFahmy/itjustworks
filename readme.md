Ever wanted a simple Linux install to have all the basic functionality working without installing and configuring every package individually? Well this is where this script comes in to rescue the day.

This Rust project is aimed to take a headless fresh install and configure basic elements like audio and printers.

This project is partially inspired by Chris Titus's Wintool.\

Download source and compile

Enable services by identifying 

## Hardware detection
printers, nvidia drivers


# Dependencies
